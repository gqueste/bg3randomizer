# Baldur's Gate 3 Character Randomizer

Silly little project to endure waiting for Baldur's Gate release.

Info has been taken from Panels from Hell and Youtube Video covering Early Access.

Links point to the community wiki, but several pages do not exist yet or may point to broken pages.

I may update when the game releases, but no promises, I have a game to play.

## Technical stack (lack of)

- All Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (because it's fun to go back to basics)
- Deploy with Netlify
